           data-caption="Every new year, people often say, “Talon ka para tumangkad ka!” “Eat 12 grapes para magkaroon ka ng boyfriend.” The most famous one is the “Ngayong taon na to, this will be my year,” I said that too, but unfortunately, it wasn’t; perhaps it was the worst. I remember the first week of the year, January 3rd, my Lolo was rushed to the hospital because he puked blood. We prayed, hoping that he would survive. Fortunately, the doctor said everything would be fine, and he just needed to rest. After what happened to my lolo, we thought everything was good and we’re at ease, but it was not until my lola unexpectedly stepped on the end line. My Lola was in a delicate condition back then; my sister usually said, “Hindi yan, malakas pa yang si Lola,” but as the saying goes, “expect the unexpected.” February 17th, 2024, my Lola’s time on earth stopped running; our tears started pouring, our hearts started breaking, and her heart stopped beating. It was my second time losing a loved one, but this one was different; our surroundings began to look pale, somehow, grey; the joy and the one who colors our world disappeared, vanished, and died. It was my first time asking God, “Why? Why is this happening to our family?” I know everything happens for a reason, but why? From that day on, I frequently started to talk to God by praying, thanking him, saying sorry, and asking how my Lola was doing in heaven. I know God is listening; I can feel his presence whenever I talk to him. I started to open up to him, telling him the struggles I've gone through and problems I can’t handle by myself; as I’m writing this reflection, I noticed that instead of being distant from God, I became closer to him. After several weeks when my Lola died, my sister-in-law announced she was pregnant; they found out that they were expecting after the week my Lola passed away; my Lola always says to my brother, “Don’t worry, twins yan, babae at lalaki.” Coincidentally, we prayed for one but we’re blessed with two: a girl and a boy! We couldn’t have been happier; we joked around saying, “Siguro kinausap ni Lola si Lord,” but for me, I think she really did; now, my nephew was named after her. My life kept on moving, not until an unexpected event happened again: my mom was diagnosed with cancer; this news shattered my heart; it was like my world stopped moving and began to crash down. I saw how my mom suffered and how she went through her life with pain; after months, suddenly, my grandma from my father’s side was rushed to the hospital unexpectedly; she passed out and was in need of surgery as soon as possible. Everything was happening so fast it was like I was in a race; Instead of winning, I felt like I was losing. It hurts seeing my loved ones suffer; now I’m back to questioning God: “Why? Why does it need to be my family?” We prayed and prayed for my mom and grandma’s recovery, and luckily, my grandma is doing better now, and my mom is cancer-free!! When I think of it, God heard me; God listened to me and gave us challenges in life so that we could be stronger and braver. God is like my coach; whenever I’m knocked down to the ground, he’s the one who supports and lifts me back up so that I can keep on fighting. From that year on, my faith in God became much stronger, and like me, I became stronger.">

           data-caption="In the past few years, there was a time that I once heard the news that Alesi is autistic. I was very sad and it will be a hard challenge to her, to my family and to myself. I have 2 sisters, Alesi is the middle child and the other is Alain, our little sister. Alesi is diagnosed with autism, there are 3 levels of autism and 3 is the highest. Before, my sister was a level 2, but thanks to her therapy she progressed to level 1. She is still attending therapy to this day. But still, as an older brother, I will have to shoulder this responsibility. Many people will treat her differently. She will have a learning disability and she will be switching schools to a homeschool this year. Even Alain will feel the burden too. I asked God why do you do this? Why do you have to make our lives hard? Why do you have to do this to my sister? I asked this question every single day. Alesi is becoming a teenager soon and her mind is still on a child level. In her school, no one is truly friends with her, but in her therapy, she has real friends. Her behavior had affected her class in her school and our home. She has episodes of tantrums each week and me and my family have always been struggling to calm her down. Even in public places like in the mall she has tantrums too. My little sister Alain tells me that she is tired and struggling to accompany Alesi. As of that, Alesi almost didn't get her first communion because of her behavior, but thanks to God, she got it and she graduated. I seemed to notice that she doesn’t know the names of her classmates to this day. But with her therapy classmates, she knows every single one of them. Our family noticed that too. She relates more to her therapy classmates than to her classmates at school. But she has talent, she likes to draw. I think her passion is drawing. In our home, she draws every day, she has stacks of stacks of paper only of her drawings. When I saw one of her drawings, I felt her love to draw things. Even in times when she is sad, angry or happy, she draws and conveys her emotions in that drawing. I asked God again, “God, is this our path? As a family?” I always pray to God to protect my family at any cost, especially my sister. I pray to her that despite her autism, she will live and grow as a normal person. I hope that she will graduate high school and college and get a job, and we will support her for it. She has a dream job that she wants to be a manga illustrator, and I have faith in God that she will get that job. I always pray to God to help her to overcome challenges in this world. I am still holding up hope and faith in God. Our family is holding up hope and faith in God. In God, we will overcome this challenge. I am not saying that God will erase her autism, I am saying that in God’s Guidance and as a family, we will help her to overcome her challenges in this world. As I’m writing this, I still feel hope and faith in God. The hope that God put us. The faith that we will overcome this, as a brother, a son, and as a family.">

           data-caption="Every Sunday, my family would go to church and for me? The idea of being there would make me sad because listening to a mass is like not listening to your teacher. You don't know what is happening or what they are saying. When I was young, I didn’t see the need to even go to church because I couldn’t even understand a thing, and even so, I still attended mass every Sunday because my father would get mad if one of us were left alone in the house. As time passed, I felt closer to my family, and sometimes, I would even talk to god to keep me and my family happy. I wanted everything to stay that way. Whenever a good thing happens, I will always be grateful for him. A little backstory. I had an operation when I was 5 years old, my appendix was removed, I was so young back then that I couldn’t remember every detail I just knew at that time. I wanted a Barbie doll for me and my twin, so I told them to buy me one. When I got better, they said yes, but they were crying. It was weird for me because they always bought toys but never shed a tear, but they did that day. And when I fell asleep, somehow, in my dreams, I saw myself in a dark room. I was so young that I didn’t even know what to do. I started crying, and with that, I began to pray to God to heal me, to make me feel better so that I wouldn’t ever experience that again. When I got older, they told me what they experienced during that point in my life. My sister told me they cried every time they went home and always prayed in the chapel and for me. What did the lord do? Did he even save me? Who put me in danger? Isn’t it God? Isn’t he the root of my suffering at that young age? But the more I questioned things, the closer I became to him because he was able to answer it through this journey. I wouldn’t say it was a blessing in disguise because I knew I suffered so much, but I would say it grew on me that God let me go through it with my family and him by my side. It just proves that he was not the reason for my suffering, he was my savior, because he never left me.  Moving forward in Grade 10, I was always happy that it made a hole in my chest. It always felt like something was missing or wrong like I was falling apart without knowing the reason. I knew I loved myself, but it seemed never enough. Everything was never sufficient to the point that I wanted to put my life in danger because it was the most depressing weeks and months of my life. It was like a never-ending cycle, but between those days, weeks, and even months, I would often cry to God about my sufferings. I always felt the need to question him even when I knew the answer. I kept asking for signs, whether good or bad, at least somehow, I knew he was listening to me. I prayed to him to make me feel okay, let me feel the beauty he made, and let me feel the love that everyone was giving me. Even if I had a lot of friends, I would still want to talk to God about everything I’ve been through, and I keep telling him, “Ikaw na po bahala sa lahat. “ If that's what he wants for me, I will accept it because I know good things would happen because of him in exchange. He made me realize that every pain I’ve been through was worth more than what I’ve experienced. But now that I’m in senior high school, it wasn’t god who would do things. It’s me. He made me realize that I am the only one who can dictate my life, but above all, he has been there with me throughout my life. I am who I am because of him and myself. I was able to grow because of him, and I was able to love and accept myself because of him. I owe it all to him.">

           data-caption="I would like to start my faith story when I was really young, at the age of 3. Most of my memories are about me being with my late uncle and late grandparents. My uncle was a priest and my grandparents were really religious people. Me and my siblings mostly spent our childhood with them. Our uncle was like a second father to us. Since we were really young our parents always let us stay with our  late uncle, and late grandparents and everytime we visit them they always teach us to be kind and faithful. And because of the time we spend with them, In kinder grade I already know how to pray the whole holy  rosary, and in elementary years I already know many prayers. Still like any other people I still have some questions about my faith most especially when I entered junior high school. A little background information about me: I was a former seminarian, I studied for 4 years in the seminary and I can really say it is never easy and always challenging. At a young age of 12 I entered the seminary. At first it was really a fun and great experience but as time passed I started to feel dispirited. The thought of being separated from your family and the outside world was already a heavy thing to carry. As one of the few selected to study in the seminary the priest formators promise us that they will form us spiritually, academically, physically, and mentally. And you can say they achieve forming us within just a year. I became prayerful, I was able to lead people, I became an honor student, an athlete,  and I was able to help and serve others. Along with my peers we were able to mature earlier than the people with the same age as us, though there may be times we do teenegers do but it is in the minimum stage. In 9th grade I really started to question my faith, I was going through many personal things back then and sometimes I prayed to God and asked many questions. Why did he choose me to enter the seminary? Why are you giving me many more problems to challenge even though I still cannot handle the things in front of me? I am thankful for all the gifts you’ve given me here, but why are you making me suffer? It got to the point in 10th grade I almost lost my faith and I had depression. But God really doesn’t abandon us even if we stray away from him. In the midst of my depression he was there to help me overcome it, he helped me through the people who are in my life, he also gave me the chance to study in UST which is one of the things I prayed to him. And as time passed I started to build my faith again even today. I started to realize and feel that God’s love is everlasting even for me, a sinner, he was still by my side helping me and giving me hope. I made a promise that Even though I do not have a plan to become a priest in the future, I Plan to keep and increase my faith, lead my family and future family to church, and help others as God helped me. And lastly every sunday when I go to church I always thank him for helping me, giving me blessings in my everyday life, and thank him for not abandoning me.">

           data-caption="As a child, I dreamed of having someone who would never leave—someone who would stay, no matter what. But dreams don’t always come true. When I was seven, both my parents left, and the silence they left behind was deafening. I watched my classmates run into their parents’ arms after school, their laughter filling the halls, while I stood alone. I told myself I didn’t care, but deep down, I envied them. I was lucky to have my grandmother. She became my everything—my mother, my father, my anchor. She filled the emptiness with warmth, and for a while, I thought I could be okay. But life has a cruel way of reminding you that stability is temporary. Change is inevitable; sometimes, it doesn’t come with promises of something better. When I moved to the UAE, I thought things would finally improve. I believed I would be closer to my mother and that the space between us would shrink. But I soon realized the distance wasn’t just physical. It was something more profound, intangible, something I couldn’t fix, no matter how hard I tried. I found myself in a place that didn’t feel like home, surrounded by people who didn’t feel like family. Every day, I felt smaller. Every night, I cried myself to sleep, drowning in thoughts I didn’t want to think. Fear became my shadow. No matter where I went, it followed. And even though I prayed—desperately, endlessly—it felt like my words dissolved before they could reach heaven. I started to wonder if God had turned away from me, or worse if He had never been there. The thoughts festered. I began to believe I deserved the pain and that it was a punishment for something I couldn’t even name. I stopped fighting it. The anger, the sadness, the exhaustion—it consumed me. One night, I stared at my reflection, eyes hollow, lips trembling. And then I screamed—a raw, guttural sound that tore through the silence of my room. But no one heard me. No one ever did. That was the moment I stopped trying. I lost my faith, and with it, I lost myself. I became quiet, distant, rebellious—not because I wanted to be, but because I didn’t know who I was anymore. I believed the world was against me and that God hated me. And if He didn’t care about me, why should I? I let the weight of my thoughts pull me under, drowning in regret, anger, and loneliness. People came and went, and whenever someone left, I felt a piece of myself go with them. I broke into fragments, unable to piece myself back together. But in the depths of my despair, I sought help again. I turned to God, not expecting immediate healing, but with a plea for guidance. I asked for strength, clarity, and forgiveness—not just from Him, but from myself. Slowly, I began to understand that my pain did not define me. My past did not dictate my future. God was not absent; I had just stopped looking for Him. I saw how He had carried me through my struggles. Even in the darkest moments, His grace was there, waiting for me to recognize it. This season of grace has inspired me to grow in faith, to believe in healing, and to strengthen my relationship with God, my family, and others. Healing is not a linear journey. Some days, I still struggle. Some nights, the shadows creep back in. But I know now that I am not alone. I see forgiveness not just as something to ask for but as something to give. I seek peace not as an end goal but as a daily practice. I am not fully recovered, but I know everything will improve. Traumas can be healed. Love can be found. Loneliness can be a lesson. And life is still a journey worth taking, no matter how painful. God guides me everywhere I go. I trust Him—He is my guidance, my light, and my strength.">

           data-caption="Moving up to 10th grade brought a big change: our batch was divided into just two sections instead of three. I struggled with change in my old school, and my friends were my comfort zone. Being separated from them was a huge challenge because I find it hard to talk to new people and make friends.As soon as the section lists were released, I looked for my name and the names of the people who were separated or remained together. The sight of my name by itself, without any of my friends, hits me hard. Our group had seven people, and I was the only one who got split up. It impacted me really hard knowing I'd be in a new section without anyone I was close to. I kept wondering, Why me? The chances seemed to be against me, or perhaps someone had deliberately chosen to keep me apart. It was difficult at first to get used to things. I didn't connect with my new classmates very well, and it was hard to make friends. I really felt the absence of my friends, especially during school activities we used to do together. It was sad seeing them continue those moments without me, even though they tried to keep me in the loop. It just wasn't the same, and sometimes I really wished things hadn't changed.With this challenge, I grew closer to my family. My parents keep me motivated and always make me feel better at times when things aren't working out for me. My siblings keep me entertained with our short trips to cafes and helping me with school work. My teachers guided me as well as giving me advice at that time, if you have a problem, just go through it, don't stay at it,  it taught me to never give up and that these obstacles are lessons we must learn and overcome. Through these small interactions really helped me as a person to grow. Other than my family, I got closer to God as well. Taking time each day for prayer has given me a deep sense of reassurance, knowing that I am guided and protected by Him, kept safe from harm, and nor leaving me from evil. God has taught me to trust Him fully, to find peace in the belief that better things are on their way, and that He knows what’s best for me. I've realized that they're not to question my value but to make me stronger, guiding me the way for change and growth changes I never expected. I discovered that the same things that make us stronger and wiser are the times that we don't want to happen. In the end, I can see that God utilized this difficulty to get me ready for more significant adjustments down the road. I also learned that real friendship isn't just about being in the same class. I'm glad that the friends were true to me and even though we were not hanging out all the time, it was easy enough to stay connected and have each other's backs whenever they needed it. And that made me appreciate my friends even more and shows how distance does not ruin true friendship.">

         data-caption="“High school will be the happiest time of your life,” my parents used to tell me, until my thirteenth birthday arrived, followed by the pandemic. My friends and I were so excited to graduate, to grow up, but we had to celebrate our graduation day online. We couldn't see each other face to face or go outside. We watched our loved ones get sick and lose their lives, while we could only wait inside our homes and pray that this storm went away sooner. One by one among my friend group, we felt depressed, but instead of supporting one another, we kept fighting over whatever, and broke apart. We were all together to begin with because of our similar home problems, but instead of ending the cycle and healing together, we were continuing the cycle and harming ourselves. My parents enrolled me somewhere else for high school. I knew nobody there, and it was difficult making friends online, but a few years later, we started having face to face classes again, so I tried befriending my peers, but they were all already close to each other before the pandemic, and I was just the odd new girl. A few months later, I didn’t know what I did for some of them to insult me behind my back and most of them to ignore me to my face, but I did know what they were doing, because I watched them, and I’ve already seen this before. I wanted to hurt them as much as they hurt me, to use the same methods my friends and family use to hurt each other, and I did, but they outnumbered me. Feeling defeated, I would return home, ignore my parents yelling at each other, and distract myself with the social media I was addicted to instead of my hobbies or interests. I envied the people I followed, I wished I could escape into their perfect lives, and I hated myself for not being good enough compared to them. Every night, I would curl up in bed, cuddling my pillow, the salty tears in my eyes burning my cheeks and staining the pillowcase, my choked sobs sounding like hiccups as I cried myself to sleep. “Was this another Great Flood, God?” I one day asked in prayer. “Since the last one, we sinned, so You punished us, but you still gave us a second chance after, but we still kept sinning. I kept sinning. So, were You … punishing us again? Are You …  punishing me?” I heard nothing but silence from Him, so I decided, punishing myself, my mind, my body, but the problem has grown too difficult to fix, so it could only be gotten rid of. I would watch His rainbow sunset, let its final lights comfort me, and imagine taking flight from our apartment’s balcony. Until one day, I received visions from Him, those of the life I could’ve led, the person I could’ve grown up to be, these plans I would’ve let drop. “I d-don’t w-want to g-go. I w-want to s-stay. God, PLEASE, GOD. I just wanted to be happy… Why WON’T YOU just LET ME be HAPPY?!” It turned dark and quiet. I apologized when I remembered that He never wanted me to be unhappy. It was me not letting myself be happy by letting my pain define me. I never deserved it, but it was my responsibility to heal myself and stop hurting anyone else. It was a calm afternoon when a dove perched upon the balcony, this winged symbol of peace carrying a branch in its beak in the Bible, a sign of dry land nearby nearing the end of the storm, that being the city my family and I were moving to for a fresh start. Since then, with His guidance, which comes in the form of lessons or people, I've been improving myself, reflecting on the past, exploring new things and forming better relationships, while taking care of my health, physically, mentally, and spiritually. I even prayed, prepared for, and got accepted into UST! The future feels bright again, and all of this is thanks to His love, mercy, and guidance.">

         data-caption="August 13, 2024, I had a seizure. This day is something that I cannot remember, but it will always frighten me, it will always define me, and even if I have no memory of my attack, it will always remind and haunt me. I would always bring this up to people, sadly, to get to know me, they had to know my sickness too. I don’t tell them for pity, I have to tell them so that they know that anytime could be my last time. So what exactly happened? The past few months before August, I had been living a little unhealthy. I would sleep late — sometimes I wouldn’t even sleep at all. I skipped meals, accidentally and intentionally. I didn’t like eating breakfast, so I stopped. Things were going so well for me, especially in August of 2024. I could say that I was happy. During that day, I got my books from the 22nd floor of Frassati. My friends and I went down to the library and I still remember buying a drink. After a while, I went down since I was already going to get picked up so my friends stayed at the ground floor waiting for my mom. I had a weird vision. It was like I saw the future and it was too fast for me to process. I shook my head to shake off the feeling and continued talking with my friends.. My mom called me that she was going to pick me up already. I don’t remember anything after, but I did feel that she was carrying me, I was heavy and I felt dizzy. I did not want to get in the car since I did not recognize it. My grandmother was there but we were in a stranger’s car. I thought that maybe something must have happened to my grandmother. We eventually got to the hospital and I was surprised that my mom carried me with all her strength out of the car. I was the one lying on the bed, not my grandma, they ran some tests. I found out I had a seizure. I also found out I had fractured my nose. I didn’t feel anything though, more importantly, I didn’t know any of that happened. She saw me with my friends. She said she was lucky she was already there by that time. However, she mentioned that how I acted was very unusual. When she called me, I replied to her normally. Knowing me, I would’ve already stood up, said goodbye to my friends and left — but I didn’t. I slowly put the phone down, I pointed up and looked up towards the left. My mom she saw me fall. She ran towards me and tried to help me. My friends and I tried to get me out of the table but I hit my nose on it and it caused a fracture. This is where my faith starts. My mom said that a girl was running to her. From the other gate of Frassati to the one we were at. She said she had long hair but she wasn’t able to see her face. She spoke to my mom and said “My dad is a doctor, please put her on her left”. She followed the girl and she mentioned that the girl said to do that and if saliva came out I’ll be fine. And it did, it prevented me from choking. She brought me to our car (yes it was ours) and brought me to St Luke's hospital. I had to share 2 perspectives since I really do not know what happened to me. But one thing for sure, God saved me. After what I heard from my mom and my friends, we asked my friends if they noticed a girl helping us and they said they didn’t. I posted this on the UST Freedom Wall, but up until today, I never found her. Was she really a student from UST? Was she just some girl my mom imagined? Those were our questions. But what I really wanted to know was, why did I not meet God when I was unconscious? This didn't make me lose my faith in Him or anything. It made me believe in Him more. Could it be that He sent her to save me? Maybe it wasn’t my time yet? What if God and I really did meet but I just don’t remember it? What if she was God? My sickness left a lot of questions unanswered. To this day we do not know what exactly happened. We ran MRI and EEG tests, and all they told us was that my frontal lobe had lost oxygen. But they found nothing to be the cause of my condition. My sickness remains heavy for me to carry. My mother has to wake me up every 6 am for me to drink Keppra — my maintenance/medicine — and I also have to take it every 6 pm the same day. My friends are not allowed to leave me alone, my family members always panic when it’s around 5-7 AM or PM worrying about me, and my cousin and brother always have to sleep beside me just to look after me since a seizure may occur at any time. My sickness brought me closer to God. We would frequently go to church before it all happened, and now my family makes sure we never miss a Sunday in church. God made me believe that He was there. ‘Nobody yells when they’re close to you’ and maybe that’s why I don’t remember hearing Him nor seeing Him. He was always close to me. He saved me in every way I could be saved. So I owe my life to Him. Retelling this story will always make my heart sink, knowing that I went through a lot. But retelling this would always remind me that I went through this with God. I would always share this story, in hopes that someone would also feel His presence.">

         data-caption="This was way back in junior high school. Throughout junior high school, I am an honor student. All my grades were in the line of 9. However, I was failing math because for me the lessons were hard, and I was not good with numbers. All my life, I have always had a hard time solving math problems and understanding complex lessons. This happened to me at the end of the first quarter. One day during math class, the teacher made us calculate our grades because we had nothing to do. I calculated my grade, and it turned out to be a 79. I expected that it would be the result I would get, but it was hard to accept. I felt down because I didn’t want to take a remedial class, and I didn’t want to disappoint my family. I felt ashamed and sad. I didn't want to tell my family about it. The next day, I went to school to talk to my teacher about it, but before that, I went to a church near my school, and then I prayed and cried. I sat there for 30 minutes, praying to God and trying to find the courage to talk with my teacher before heading to my school. After a few hours, I waited for her, and then when I saw her, I talked with my teacher to ask if there was anything I could do to boost my grades to a line of 8. She said that there was nothing I could do. So, I accepted it even if it made me feel depressed. A few days passed by, and the teachers released our grades. I was expecting to get a 79, but what I saw was an 81. I was shocked and appalled to see my grade in math in a line of 8. I was so happy. I talked to my math teacher regarding my grade, and she told me my scores had been miscalculated. She noticed the miscalculation, and then she computed it again, which resulted in my grade being a line of 8. I was very thankful. I know that God didn’t go down from heaven to correct my grades, but I felt closer to God because I learned that when times were rough, I could depend on him as my pillar of strength. When I didn’t want to tell anyone what I was going through, I realized that I could tell him all my problems. I never really realized that despite growing up in a religious family, I felt distant towards God. I am really thankful for being able to experience such a challenging experience because it taught me that God is there by my side to accompany me, even on my worst days. I also gathered the motivation to study harder for the next quarter in order for my grade to improve. At the end of the school year, I did okay with mathematics. My grades weren't high, but it was OK. I felt contented because at least I passed.">

         data-caption="There was a time in my life when I felt overwhelmed by uncertainty and despair. It was a period of deep personal struggle that tested my faith, my resilience, and my relationship with God. It all began when I turned 16, then a month later, my first dog passed. This put a heavy weight and burden on me since she has been by my side ever since I could remember. I could count the times where I experienced hardships, adding on to this grief, only weeks after. Having to juggle keeping my academics consistent, attending to my class’ needs, and being responsible for making myself feel better. Soon after, a few weeks after Christmas and the new year, I experienced an even harder challenge that I have been trying to put aside, thinking “Baka naman ako lang ‘to and it’s nothing naman”. Then things started to not make sense. Why was my class not talking to me as much like before the semester break? Why was there this sudden shift with my friends?. As a person who needed clarity to why this was happening to me, I tried to consult my then friends, who knew what I have been going through these past few months, hoping that they’d help me understand; but to my surprise, they only said “Ganon talaga”. Still confused, I shrugged it off, thinking na wala naman talaga siguro nangyayari and it was just me overthinking. A few days passed, and I was confronted with another challenge. This time, I caught my class officers by the end of the hallway, talking amongst themselves. Curious, I slowly approached them, starting the conversation with “Ano ginagawa niyo dito?”. Being the class president, I was confused as to why a “meeting” was called without my knowledge. One of the officers answered “We were just discussing a few things”. Thinking that if ever there was a matter to be discussed, I would be notified. “Anong a few things?” I asked, “We were just discussing your leadership, and how it affects our class”. Shocked, confused, bewildered; I felt as my hands started to shake, my eyes were getting heavy, and I felt as if my face started to warm. Hearing their insights and comments as to how I run the class, made me question my capabilities. As a home-grown student-leader, this took a toll on me. At first, I looked at this positively, not until they mentioned things that I do, from their perspective, negatively. The things they mentioned were so generic, like how there are times where I don’t respond immediately. In my head I though, pag sila gumagawa okay lang kasi naiintindihan ko, pero pag ako mali agad? Not wanting to go into too much detail on how things panned out, due to this unforeseen circumstance, my mental health started to get concerning, not only because my character was attacked during those days, but also because I was letting my thoughts and feelings overpower my reasoning. Because of this, my parents thought that it was best for me to switch blocks, hoping to help me get a peace of mind. In the midst of this tumultuous time, I found myself questioning everything: my purpose, my faith, and even the very existence of God’s love for me. I remember praying, but it often felt as if my words were simply drifting away unanswered. I felt alone, not only in my struggles but in my silence as well. It was not an immediate transformation, but a gradual awakening to the truth that God’s love and mercy were present even in my darkest moments. Through the readings and reflections of the Jubilee Year, I began to understand that my struggles were not a sign of abandonment from God, but rather an invitation to experience His mercy in a deeper way. I realized that God’s love is not conditional or dependent on my circumstances, but constant and ever-present, even when I feel unworthy or lost. In this Jubilee Year, I have been reminded that God’s mercy is endless, and His love knows no bounds. I am forever grateful for this season of grace, which has drawn me closer to Him and to those I love. It has given me the strength to keep moving forward, knowing that no matter the struggles I may face, I am never alone. God is with me, and His love will always guide me through.">
