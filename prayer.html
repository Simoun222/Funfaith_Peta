  <h2>(Sign of the Cross)</h2>
  <p>O Lord, Creator of all things, we ask for your blessing to help us be more like Blessed Giorgo of Frassati, a man of beatitudes, profound lover of the poor, and a devoted follower to you. We thank you for giving us every waking day to have a chance to serve you and serve others. Grace us with charitable hearts to help those who are in need. May they be protected by the power of the Holy Spirit and by your loving embrace. We pray that you may inspire us to be stronger and joyful through your gratitude and joy. Grant us the spirit to aim high, just as the mountains Blessed Giorgo of Frassati have climbed. And just like your Apostles and all the saints, we pray that we may live our life serving you and encourage more people to continue building the foundation of your church by serving others as well. And by The all powerful Father, the loving mercy of the Son,  the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and through the intercession of the blessed virgin Mary. We pray, Amen. Blessed Giorgio of Frassati, Pray For us.</p>
