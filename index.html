  <h2>Welcome to Frassati's Legacy</h2>
  <p>Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati (1901–1925) lived a short yet impactful life filled with faith, joy, and dedication to the poor. Born into an influential family in Turin, Italy, he chose the path of humility and service, embodying the Gospel in daily life. This website honors his life, virtue, and voice—a beacon for youth, laypeople, and social reformers alike.</p>

  <h2>Why He Inspires Millions</h2>
  <p>Frassati did not perform miracles in the traditional sense, but his life was a miracle of compassion.

His blend of spiritual depth and practical action makes him a saint for our modern times.</p>

  <h2>What is the Jubilee Year 2025?</h2>
  <img src="https://media.vaticannews.va/media/content/dam-archive/vaticannews/multimedia/2022/06/28/1656411932870-LogoGiubileo2025-IngleseAEM.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.750.422.jpeg">
  <p> The concept of "Jubilee" has its roots in the Book of Leviticus (chapter 25) as a unique year of reconciliation, pilgrimage, and coming home. 2025 is the Jubilee Holy Year, the 2,025th anniversary of the Incarnation of our Lord, a "event of great spiritual, ecclesial, and social significance in the life of the Church." The Holy Year of 2025 has been proclaimed by Pope Francis as a moment to reaffirm our commitment to being "Pilgrims of Hope."</p>
